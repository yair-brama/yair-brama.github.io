I'm a Solutions and Delivery Leader with 20+ years of experience driving complex, enterprise-scale initiatives across cloud, data, AI, and business systems in telecommunications, financial services, SaaS, and regulated environments.

I specialize in owning end-to-end delivery—from solution definition and architecture through execution—leading global, cross-functional teams to deliver measurable business outcomes. My work spans defining product features, large-scale system integrations, predictive analytics platforms, and cloud-native data solutions.

Recently, I designed and delivered an Azure-based, agentic-AI web application for large-scale financial data migration, automating 80% of migration effort and reducing per-client migration time by 70%. I've also led high-impact initiatives such as a Airflow orchestration upgrade for JetBlue on Google Cloud, introducing governance and release management at scale.

Known as a trusted partner to executives and clients, I bring structure to ambiguity—aligning strategy, technology, and delivery while building and mentoring high-performing global teams. My background blends program management, solution architecture, data science, and cloud engineering, enabling me to bridge business goals with technical execution.

Open to Solutions Leadership, Delivery Leadership, and Technical Program Management roles where execution, scale, and impact matter.

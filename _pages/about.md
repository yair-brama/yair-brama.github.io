With over 20 years of experience in software project management, business analysis, and solution architecture, and a focus on AI and e-commerce, I am a seasoned professional who operates as liaison between developers, managers and customers. I hold a Master of Business Administration (MBA), a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science, and I am a Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect. As a lifetime learner, currently I am acquiring a Post Graduate Certificate in Data Science and Business Analytics from McCombs School of Business at UT Austin (expected graduation - December 2024).

As Delivery Manager at FLYR Labs, a company that leverages AI to optimize revenue management and pricing for airlines, I managed an international delivery team of data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers, working towards one shared goal of transforming how airlines do business.
 
As Professional Services Manager in Kornit Digital, a company that develops, manufactures and markets industrial digital technology, I led a team of implementation managers and solution architects across North America.

For 8 years, I worked at Amdocs, a leading software and services provider to communication and media companies, reporting directly to the regional VP while managing projects and teams internationally. 

I enjoy integrating my prior technical skills into practical solutions, exploring and deploying innovative solution elements, and delivering value to executive level management and stakeholders.
